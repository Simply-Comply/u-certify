# U-Certify Platform MVP - Business Analysis Overview

## Executive Summary

The U-Certify Platform is a cloud-based compliance management system designed to help Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) maintain accreditation compliance while efficiently conducting client certifications. The MVP focuses on ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 standard for management system certification bodies, addressing the critical need for digital transformation in the certification industry.

**Key Business Drivers:**

- 70% of CABs still use paper-based or spreadsheet systems
- Average audit report generation time: 4-6 hours (manual process)
- 15% of CABs face accreditation suspensions due to compliance gaps
- Growing demand for remote/hybrid assessments post-2020

**MVP Investment:** $400-600K  
**Time to Market:** 8 months  
**Target Market:** Small to medium CABs (initially 20-50 pilot customers)

---

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Conformity Assessment Bodies face increasing pressure to:

1. Maintain strict compliance with accreditation standards
2. Reduce operational costs while maintaining quality
3. Scale operations without proportional headcount increase
4. Provide transparency to clients and accreditation bodies
5. Adapt to remote/hybrid assessment models

Current solutions are either:

- **Generic QMS software**: Not tailored to CAB-specific workflows
- **Paper-based systems**: Inefficient, error-prone, difficult to audit
- **Custom in-house solutions**: Expensive to maintain, lacking standardization

### Market Opportunity

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: ~5,000 CABs globally
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: ~2,000 CABs in English-speaking markets
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: 200 CABs (10% market share in 5 years)
- **Average Revenue per CAB**: $15,000-50,000/year (based on size)
