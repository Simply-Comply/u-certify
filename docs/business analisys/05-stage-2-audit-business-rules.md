## State Transitions

### Valid State Transitions

- **Planned** → **In Progress** (audit commenced)
- **In Progress** → **Completed** (audit finished)
- **Completed** → **Report Drafted** (findings documented)
- **Report Drafted** → **Report Issued** (QA complete)
- **Planned** → **Postponed** (justified delay)
- **Report Issued** → **Follow-up Required** (majors identified)
- **Report Issued** → **Certification Recommended** (no majors)

### State Invariants

- "In Progress" MUST have team on-site
- "Completed" MUST have all findings classified
- "Report Issued" MUST have recommendation decision

## Integration Points

- Follow-up audit planning
- Client portal updates

## Performance Indicators

- Major vs. minor NC ratio
- Certification recommendation rate
- Report issuance timeliness
- Corrective action closure rate

### Quality Indicators
