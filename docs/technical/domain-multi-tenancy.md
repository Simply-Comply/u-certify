# U-Certify Multi-Tenancy Design

## Overview

This document outlines the multi-tenancy architecture for the U-Certify platform, where each **Conformity Assessment Body (CAB)** operates as an independent tenant with complete data isolation and customizable business rules.

**Architecture**: Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform  
**Tenant Model**: CAB-per-Tenant  
**Isolation Strategy**: Logical separation with domain-enforced boundaries  
**Tenant Identification**: CAB ID serves as primary tenant identifier

---

## Multi-Tenancy Design Approach

### Tenant Model
In UCertify, each **Conformity Assessment Body (CAB)** represents a separate tenant:

- **Tenant**: CAB organization (e.g., "ABC Certification Ltd", "Quality Assurance Corp")
- **Tenant Isolation**: All aggregates are scoped to a specific CAB
- **Data Separation**: Logical separation with CAB-scoped data access
- **Business Rules**: Some rules are tenant-specific (CAB accreditation scope, policies)
- **Customization**: Tenant-specific workflows, branding, and configurations

### Domain-Aware Multi-Tenancy

**Approach**: **Domain-Aware Multi-Tenancy**
- Tenant context is part of the domain model (not just infrastructure)
- All aggregate roots include tenant identification
- Business rules can be tenant-specific
- Domain services are tenant-scoped
- Cross-tenant operations are explicitly prevented at domain level

---

## Key Multi-Tenant Design Considerations

### 1. Data Isolation Strategies

**Logical Separation (Chosen Approach)**
- All queries include tenant filter automatically
- Single database with tenant-aware data access
- Cost-effective for large number of small-medium tenants
- Simplified backup/restore operations

**Benefits:**
- Lower infrastructure costs
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified monitoring

**Considerations:**
- Requires robust tenant filtering at all levels
- Risk of tenant data leakage if not properly implemented
- Performance may degrade with very large tenants

### 2. Business Rules & Customization

**Global Rules (e.g. ISO 17021 Compliance)**

**Tenant-Specific Rules (set by Tenant admin)**

### 3. Certificate Numbering Strategy

**Globally Unique with CAB Branding**

### 4. Security & Access Control

**Tenant-Scoped User Management**

## Integration Considerations

### Cross-Tenant Operations (OOS for MVP)

**Permitted Cross-Tenant Operations:**
- Public certificate verification
- Anonymous benchmarking data
- Platform-level reporting (aggregated)
- System maintenance operations

**Forbidden Cross-Tenant Operations:**
- Direct access to another CAB's data
- Cross-tenant auditor assignments
- Shared client data
- Cross-tenant compliance information

---

## Performance & Scalability

### Tenant Data Distribution

**Small-Medium CABs (< 1000 certificates)**
- Shared database with logical separation
- Standard indexing strategy
- Regular maintenance windows

**Large CABs (> 1000 certificates)**
- Consider dedicated read replicas
- Enhanced indexing strategies
- Priority support and maintenance

**Enterprise CABs (> 10,000 certificates)**
- Dedicated database instances
- Custom SLA agreements
- 24/7 support

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Per-Tenant Metrics:**
- Active certificate count
- Monthly assessment volume
- Compliance score
- User activity levels
- System performance

**Platform-Level Metrics:**
- Total tenant count
- System-wide performance
- Security incidents
- Data integrity checks

## Future Multi-Tenant Enhancements

### Phase 2 Considerations

**Cross-Tenant Analytics**
- Anonymous benchmarking reports
- Industry trend analysis
- Performance comparisons
- Best practice sharing

**Tenant Hierarchies**
- CAB subsidiaries support
- Shared resource management
- Consolidated reporting
- Group-level administration

**White-Label Solutions**
- Tenant-branded interfaces
- Custom domain support
- Personalized workflows
- CAB-specific terminology

**Regional Compliance**
- Data residency requirements
- Local language support
- Region-specific business rules
- Compliance with local laws

**Note**: Multi-tenancy is a foundational architectural decision that impacts every aspect of the platform. This design ensures complete tenant isolation while enabling efficient resource sharing and platform management.
