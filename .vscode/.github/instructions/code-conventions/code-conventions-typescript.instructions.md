# Project coding standards for C#

Apply the [code-conventions-general.instructions.md](./code-conventions-general.instructions.md) to all code.

## TypeScript Code Conventions

1. Prefer single `switch` statement over multiple (more than 2) `if` blocks.
2. Always add braces for `if` and `for` blocks.
3. Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned, and `let` for variables that are reassigned.
4. Use explicit access modifiers (private, public, protected) for clarity.
5. Use `PascalCase` for component names
6. Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, and props
7. Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
